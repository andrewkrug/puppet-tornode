# Introduction

This module is meant to facilitate the rapid deployment of tor nodes for a tor research project.

## Background

This module builds orginally on the work of Brandon Kester and Jeff McJunkin's work and ideas for profiling bits of the tor network and logging that data in an automated way over time.

## To do:

* Add GPG Support to Repos
* Automate notification of when a tor node becomes a guard.
* ERB Generated NGINX status pages
* Automate reporting to whatever the data collection mechanism is
* Get information gathering scripts from Jeff/Brandon
